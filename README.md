# CFD Project 3 - 1D Wave Equation

## Introduction

"CFD_Project3.py" is a python script written by Spencer Kenison
to predict the linear propagation of a 1-D wave using periodic
boundary conditions. It was written for MAE 5440 at Utah State University.

## Requirements

The script was written using Python 3.11 interpreter but any similar 
version should function normally.

The script requires the following libraries to be installed:
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- math
using PIP or other package-management system.

## Running program

Run the "CFD_Project3.py" file using Python interpreter. Can be run
in terminal using "python CFD_Project3.py" command or from IDE such
as VSCode.

The python program will show the theoretical propogation of a 
pre-defined 1-D wave equation and plot the results at a variety of 
predefined time points.

Different variables can be modified within the program including:
- Wave Speed
- CFL number
- Desired gridsize
- Time interval
- X Interval

With more modification, the algorithms used to solve wave propagation 
can also be modified or replaced
